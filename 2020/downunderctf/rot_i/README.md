# rot_i

The string uses cesar cypher, where `i` is equal to the position of the character in the string, i.e. the first character is rot-0, the second character is rot-1, etc. The python script tries to solve it starting from every number from 0 to 25 (0 was the right answer, easy right?). 

The whole sentence translates in : `you've solved the beginner crypto challenge! the flag is ductf{crypto_is_fun_kjqlptzy}. now get out some pen and paper for the rest of them, they won't all be this easy :).` Inside the sentence there is also the flag: `DUCTF{crypto_is_fun_kjqlptzy}`.
